# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

This repository contains a refactored version of the code available in https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata, more specifically, for the C# version (.NET Core). In this repository, the original code is kept in 'GildedRose/OriginalCode' for reference.

The requirements are available here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt

From Wikipedia: "A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps programmers hone their skills through practice and repetition." so, that's the goal of this :)
